Functional Connectivity</h2> <p>At the level of basic measurements, neuroimaging data can be said to consist typically of a set of signals (usually time series) at each of a collection of pixels (in two dimensions) or voxels (in three dimensions). Building from such data, various forms of higher-level data representations are employed in neuroimaging<d-cite key="ginestetHypothesisTestingNetwork2017"></d-cite>. Since brain regions cooperate within large-scale functional networks to support specific cognitive processes, increasingly in recent years, there has emerged a substantial interest in network-based representations<d-cite key="warnickBayesianApproachEstimating2018"></d-cite>.</p> <p>There are three main types of brain connectivity:</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th style="text-align: left">Connectivity Type</th> <th style="text-align: left">Description</th> <th style="text-align: left">Modality</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td style="text-align: left"><strong>Functional Connectivity</strong></td> <td style="text-align: left">Investigates the <strong>undirected</strong> statistical dependence between separate brain regions characterized by similar temporal dynamics. It does not imply direct structural connection.</td> <td style="text-align: left">fMRI, EEG, MEG</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: left"><strong>Effective Connectivity</strong></td> <td style="text-align: left">Refers to the <strong>directed, or causal</strong> influence of one region over another.</td> <td style="text-align: left">fMRI, EEG, MEG, TMS</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: left"><strong>Structural Connectivity</strong></td> <td style="text-align: left">Investigates the <strong>physical connections</strong> (e.g., axons, white matter) between brain regions.</td> <td style="text-align: left">DTI, sMRI</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>Functional connectivities are inferred when signals from two separate regions fluctuate in synchrony. Basically, computing correlation. Signals can be from any modalities. For example:</p> <ul> <li> <strong>fMRI:</strong> Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) provides an indirect measure of neuronal activity by evaluating changes in blood oxygenation over different areas of the brain. Good spatial resolution, low temporal resolution.</li> <li> <strong>EEG / MEG:</strong> Measures <strong>electrical/magnetic activity</strong> directly. Excellent temporal resolution, lower spatial resolution.</li> </ul> <h2 id="ii-functional-gradients-low-dimensional-representation">II. Functional Gradients: Low-Dimensional Representation</h2> <h3 id="1-the-curse-of-dimensionality">1. The Curse of Dimensionality</h3> <ul> <li> <strong>The Problem:</strong> Functional connectivity analysis generates a $p \times p$ matrix, where $p$ is the number of brain regions. If $p=400$, each region is defined by a complex 400-dimensional connectivity vector. This high-dimensional space is noisy, difficult to visualize, and computationally expensive to model.</li> <li> <strong>The Solution:</strong> Dimensionality reduction techniques (e.g., PCA, t-SNE, Diffusion Mapping) are applied to extract the “dominant axes” of variance. These axes represent the underlying organizational principles of the brain.</li> </ul> <h3 id="2-why-called-gradient">2. Why called “Gradient”?</h3> <p>A <strong>Functional Gradient</strong> is analogous to a Principal Component (PC) score, serving as a continuous coordinate system for the brain. Rather than categorizing regions into discrete clusters, a gradient positions each region along a continuous spectrum determined by the similarity of its connectivity profile.</p> <h3 id="3-why-use-functional-gradients">3. Why use Functional Gradients?</h3> <p>It is low-dimensional but encodes the brain activity sufficiently well. For example, gradients is shown to distinguish between primary sensory/motor regions (e.g., Visual Cortex) that process immediate external stimuli and association regions (e.g., Default Mode Network) involved in abstract, internal cognition like memory and planning.</p> <h2 id="iii-data-acquisition-workflow">III. Data Acquisition Workflow</h2> <p>This workflow moves beyond simple “Region A connects to Region B” analysis to map the macro-scale hierarchy of the brain.</p> <h3 id="1-workflow-steps">1. Workflow Steps</h3> <ol> <li> <strong>Construct Connectivity Matrix:</strong> <ul> <li> <em>Input:</em> Time-series data for $p$ regions.</li> <li> <em>Operation:</em> Pearson correlation between all pairs.</li> <li> <em>Result:</em> <strong>Symmetric, Dense Matrix</strong>.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <strong>Row-wise Thresholding:</strong> <ul> <li> <em>Operation:</em> For each row, keep only the top 10% strongest connections.</li> <li> <em>Result:</em> <strong>Sparse, Asymmetric Matrix</strong>. (Asymmetry arises because being in A’s top 10% doesn’t guarantee A is in B’s top 10%).</li> <li> <em>Purpose:</em> Filter out noise and weak correlations.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <strong>Affinity Matrix Calculation:</strong> <ul> <li> <em>Operation:</em> Compute <strong>Cosine Similarity</strong> between the sparse rows (connectivity profiles).</li> <li> <em>Question:</em> “Do Region A and Region B have similar ‘friends’ (connectivity patterns)?”</li> <li> <em>Result:</em> <strong>Symmetric Affinity Matrix</strong>. represents <em>contextual similarity</em>, not direct correlation.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <strong>Dimensionality Reduction:</strong> <ul> <li> <em>Operation:</em> Apply <strong>Diffusion Map Embedding</strong>.</li> <li> <em>Result:</em> <strong>Principal Gradients</strong>.
