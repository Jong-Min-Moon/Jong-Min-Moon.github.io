I am a 2nd year PhD student in the [Data Sciences and Operations Department](https://www.marshall.usc.edu/departments/data-sciences-and-operations)
at the University of Southern California. My current research focuses on high-dimensional clustering using semi-definite programming, advised by [Prof. Yingying Fan](https://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/yingying-fan/) and [Prof. Paromita Dubey](https://www.paromitadubey.com/).
 I investigated  the privacy-utility trade-off in private two-sample (A/B) testing using minimax statistical theory under the guidance of [Prof. Ilmun Kim](https://ilmunk.github.io/), during  my Master's  in Statistics from Yonsei University in Seoul, South Korea. Prior to that, I served as an artificial intelligence researcher at the [Center for Army Analysis and Simulations (CAAS)](https://www.army.mil.kr/english/357/subview.do) for the Republic of Korea Army, focusing on class imbalance issues in statistical learning, advised [Prof. Jaeoh Kim](https://sites.google.com/inha.ac.kr/pcrl/members/professor?authuser=0). I also completed my Bachelor's degree in Statistics at Yonsei University.

<summary><a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2024.120956">Sex differences in autism spectrum disorder using class imbalance adjusted functional connectivity.</a></summary>

Detecting sex differences in brain connectome organization in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) through statistical hypothesis testing is challenging. This challenge arises from the reliance of statistical power on the smaller group size, coupled with the significant imbalance in diagnostic ratios of ASD between males and females. While 
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/01621459.2013.800763">Chen et al. (2013, Journal of the American Statistical Association)</a>
 addressed this issue using an ensemble of undersampling approaches, we take an alternative approach: oversampling. 

Our method combines dimension reduction via diffusion map embedding with Gaussian mixture model-based oversampling to balance the sex ratio in functional connectivity data. This approach reveals significant sex-related differences in the sensorimotor, attention, and default mode networks, with gradients linked to higher-order cognitive control. Transcriptomic analysis identifies gene enrichment in the cortex, thalamus, and striatum. Notably, gradient-symptom associations differ by sex, with stronger effects observed in females. These findings highlight the sex heterogeneity in ASD's large-scale brain networks.
