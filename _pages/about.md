I am a second-year PhD student in the [Data Sciences and Operations Department](https://www.marshall.usc.edu/departments/data-sciences-and-operations)
at the University of Southern California. My current research focuses on high-dimensional clustering using semi-definite programming, advised by [Prof. Yingying Fan](https://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/yingying-fan/) and [Prof. Paromita Dubey](https://www.paromitadubey.com/).
 I investigated  the **privacy-utility trade-off** in private two-sample (A/B) testing using minimax statistical theory under the guidance of [Prof. Ilmun Kim](https://ilmunk.github.io/), during  my Master's  in Statistics from Yonsei University in Seoul, South Korea. Prior to that, I served as an artificial intelligence researcher at the [Center for Army Analysis and Simulations (CAAS)](https://www.army.mil.kr/english/357/subview.do) for the Republic of Korea Army, focusing on class imbalance issues in statistical learning, advised by [Prof. Jaeoh Kim](https://sites.google.com/inha.ac.kr/pcrl/members/professor?authuser=0). I also completed my Bachelor's degree in Statistics at Yonsei University.
