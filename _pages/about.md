I am a third-year PhD student in the [Data Sciences and Operations Department](https://www.marshall.usc.edu/departments/data-sciences-and-operations)
at the University of Southern California. I am advised by [Prof. Yingying Fan](https://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/yingying-fan/) and [Prof. Paromita Dubey](https://www.paromitadubey.com/). My current research focuses on using bandit algorithms as a optimization tool to address problems in statistics and operations research, including high-dimensional clustering and dynamic pricing. 

Before starting my PhD, I studied:
1.  Privacyâ€“utility trade-off in private two-sample (A/B) testing using minimax statistical theory with [Prof. Ilmun Kim](https://ilmunk.github.io/),
2.  High-dimensional brain signal analysis for the development of neural probe, with [Dr. Young-Geun Park](https://www.younggeunpark.com/) and [Prof. Jang-Ung Park](https://www.younggeunpark.com/),
3. Regression for mixed functional-Euclidean data for medical image analysis, with [Prof. Jeong Hoon Jang](https://sites.google.com/view/jejang),
4. The use of generative models to address class imbalance in machine learning, with [Prof. Jaeoh Kim](https://sites.google.com/inha.ac.kr/pcrl/members/professor?authuser=0), at the [Center for Army Analysis and Simulations (CAAS)](https://www.army.mil.kr/english/357/subview.do), a research department of the Republic of Korea Army.
