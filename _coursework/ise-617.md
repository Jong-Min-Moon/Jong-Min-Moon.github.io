## Course Description
The course covers recent results on combining the strengths of Machine Learning (ML)/ Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Mixed-Integer Optimization (MIO) technologies. It discusses how MIO can be used to enhance AI methods in settings with scarce and unreliable data, in high-stakes situations where interpretability and fairness play fundamental roles, and when tackling engineering problems requiring human-AI collaborations. 

The course also explores how AI can be used to improve solving MIO problems, using it to learn ML-based alternatives to key heuristic components of MIO solvers such as branching, understand the key structural properties of a given instance, learn effective configurations of MIO solvers and predict the performance of a given algorithm, thus improving decision-making throughout the solution process.

## Learning Objectives
After completing this course, students will be able to:
1. Formulate and solve AI/ML problems using MIO technology.
2. Apply different ML techniques in the context of mixed-integer optimization.
3. Read and write a paper at the intersection of AI/ML and MIO.
