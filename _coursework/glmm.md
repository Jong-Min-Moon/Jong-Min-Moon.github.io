## Course Goals and Overview
This course covers the theory and data analysis methods of **Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMM)**. 
GLMM is fundamentally an extension of regression analysis:
1.  **Response Variable Extension**: Extends from normal distribution to distributions in the **exponential family**.
    *   Binomial distribution $\rightarrow$ Logistic regression
    *   Poisson distribution $\rightarrow$ Poisson regression
2.  **Predictor Variable Extension**: Extends to include not only **fixed effects** but also **random effects**.

Through these extensions, students will study **Covariance Pattern Models** and **Random Coefficient Models (Hierarchical Models)**, and learn how to analyze **Longitudinal Data**.

## Prerequisites
Enrollment is restricted to students who have completed the following prerequisite courses. Verification of grades in the first class is required.
1.  **Undergraduate Mathematical Statistics II** or **Graduate Mathematical Statistics**
2.  **Undergraduate Regression Analysis** or **Graduate Linear Models**

## Course Operation
*   **2 Hours**: Pre-recorded video lectures uploaded to RunUs. Students can watch at their convenience.
*   **1 Hour**: Real-time interaction with students via Zoom.
*   **Focus**: Lectures will be based on the instructor's notes. The course will focus on case studies analyzing various models using **SAS**.


## Instructor Information
