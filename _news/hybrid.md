A new [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16364) for simultaneous supervised dimension reduction and regression in multimodal data is now on [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.16364). Motivated by renal imaging studies where predictors consists of  photon count curve with pharmacokinetic and demographic variables, the approach is designed to effectively handle intermodal correlations and improve prediction accuracy.
