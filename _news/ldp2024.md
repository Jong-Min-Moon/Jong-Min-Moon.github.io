[My paper](http://jmlr.org/papers/v26/24-2016.html)  has been published in the *Journal of Machine Learning Research*! 🎉 We propose private permutation-based two-sample tests incorporating U-statistic, Laplace mechanism and Google's RAPPOR mechanism, and we derive the minimax rates that characterize the privacy–utility trade-off.
