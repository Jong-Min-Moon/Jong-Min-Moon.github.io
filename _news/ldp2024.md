[My work](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.09064), co-authored with my master's advisor [Ilmun Kim](https://ilmunk.github.io/index.html), has been accepted by the *Journal of Machine Learning Research*! 🎉 We propose private permutation-based two-sample tests incorporating U-statistic, Laplace mechanism and Google's RAPPOR mechanism, and we derive the minimax rates that characterize the privacy–utility trade-off.
