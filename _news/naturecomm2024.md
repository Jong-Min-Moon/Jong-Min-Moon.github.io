My collaboration with [Wearable Lab](http://wearablelab.net/main/main.php) at Yonsei University's Department of Materials Science and Engineering on **Nobel Soft Neural Probe** has been accepted by [*Nature Communications*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-45768-0)!  In this work, I contributed to **clustering and testing high-dimensional neural signals** to analyze the probe's performance.
