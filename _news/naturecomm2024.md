My collaborative work on the soft neural probe has been accepted by [Nature Communications](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-45768-0)! I contributed by applying spectral clustering for neural spike sorting and performing high-dimensional neural signal testing to evaluate probe performance.
