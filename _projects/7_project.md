This project aims to address the challenges of integrating soft neural probes with biological tissues. By utilizing high-resolution printing of liquid electronics, we can create interconnects directly on the cranium, minimizing mechanical mismatch and improving long-term stability.

## Key Objectives
1.  Develop a high-resolution printing process for liquid metal alloys.
2.  Demonstrate stable electrical connections on curved biological surfaces.
3.  Validate in-vivo performance and biocompatibility.
