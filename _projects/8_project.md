Local Differential Privacy (LDP) allows for data analysis while guaranteeing that individual data entries remain private, even from the data aggregator. This project focuses on developing robust hypothesis testing methods in the LDP setting.

**Key Objectives:**
- Design optimal test statistics for LDP data.
- Analyze the trade-off between privacy budgets and statistical power.
- Apply these methods to real-world distributed datasets.
