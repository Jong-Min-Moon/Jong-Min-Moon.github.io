This project addresses the statistical challenge of estimating heterogeneous treatment effects (HTEs) in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), where female participants are significantly underrepresented using class imbalance adjusted functional connectivity. By employing a cluster-aware generative model for oversampling, we improve the stability of estimates for the female subgroup.

Our findings reveal significant sex-specific functional connectivity patterns associated with higher-order cognitive control functions, highlighting the importance of proper statistical handling of imbalanced biomedical data.
