Off-policy evaluation with history-dependent importance weighting provides unbiased estimates but induces a highly ill-conditioned, nonconvex objective, making naive gradient-based optimization unstable. We propose a weighted second-moment preconditioned gradient ascent method that stabilizes learning by accounting for the variance and curvature of importance-weighted gradients. In simulations motivated by glucose regulation, our method converges faster, reduces variability across runs, and achieves higher estimated policy values than naive gradient ascent. These results underscore the importance of geometry-aware optimization in offpolicy learning under partial observability.</p> <p>This project began as the final assignment for DSO-603: Causal Inference with Modern Machine Learning Methods, offered at USC in Fall 2025. The core idea of transitioning from POMDP OPE to learning was suggested by Donggyu Derek Cho, a PhD student in Statistics at Duke University.</p> </body></html>
