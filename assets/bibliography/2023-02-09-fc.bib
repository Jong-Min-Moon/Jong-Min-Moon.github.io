Functional connectivity refers to the correlations between neural signal time series across different brain regions, in contrast to the physical (structural) connections between them. We are interested in understanding how autism causally affects functional connectivity, and whether this effect differs between sexes. From a statistical perspective, this problem corresponds to estimating heterogeneous treatment effects (HTEs). Because autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is diagnosed more frequently in males than in females, the number of female participants in the autism group is substantially smaller. As a result, female samples contribute less to the HTE estimation algorithm, leading to potentially unstable estimates for females. To address this subgroup imbalance, we employ oversampling using a cluster-aware generative model. The augmented data increase the representation of female samples in the HTE estimation process, thereby improving the stability and reliability of HTE estimates for females. Our results reveal that several brain regions exhibit significant HTEs that were not detectable prior to oversampling. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the identified HTEs are not random noise but have clear biological meaning: they are strongly associated with higher-order cognitive control functions, rather than lower-level sensory processing, and are linked to autism-related genes.
