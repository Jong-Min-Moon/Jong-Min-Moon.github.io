Our results indicate that the sex differences in ASD are not random. The identified Heterogeneous Treatment Effects (HTEs) are strongly clustered in regions associated with **higher-order cognitive control functions**, rather than ensuring lower-level sensory processing areas. This suggests that the manifestation of ASD may diverge between sexes particularly in how complex information is integrated and regulated.
