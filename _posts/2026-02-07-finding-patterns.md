Sometimes data looks like pure noise, but with the right tools, patterns emerge.

In our [Sample Coursework Project](/coursework/sample_coursework/), we explored how to use simple statistical methods to filter out the noise.

## The Idea

Imagine you have a signal $S(t)$ and noise $N(t)$. The observed data is:

$$ X(t) = S(t) + N(t) $$

Our goal is to recover $S(t)$.

## The Solution

By applying a rolling average or a more sophisticated filter, we can smooth out the fluctuations. It's amazing how much clarity a simple operation can bring!
