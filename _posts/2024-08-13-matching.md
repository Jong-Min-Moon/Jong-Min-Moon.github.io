## I. The Counterfactual Framework (Rubin Causal Model)

In the potential outcomes framework, for each unit $i$, we define:

* **Treatment ($D_i$):** A binary indicator.
* **Covariates ($X_i$):** A vector of pre-treatment characteristics.
* **Potential Outcomes:**  $Y_i(1), Y_i(0)$.

The **Individual Treatment Effect (ITE)**:
$$\tau_i = Y_i(1) - Y_i(0)$$
is a random variable. It is not observed since we only observe one outcome for each unit:
$$Y_i = D_i Y_i(1) + (1 - D_i) Y_i(0)$$

Since we cannot calculate $\tau_i$ directly, we instead estimate **Average Treatment Effect (ATE)**:
$$\tau_{ATE} = E[Y(1) - Y(0)]$$


## II. The Naive Estimator and Selection Bias

### 1. The Naive Comparison
In observational studies where the treatment allocation probability $\pi$ is not equal to $0.5$, one might use the **Naive Estimator**:
$$\hat{\delta}_{naive} = \hat{E}[Y | D=1] - \hat{E}[Y | D=0]$$
which converges to 
$$E[Y(1) | D=1] - E[Y(0) | D=0]$$
which consists of conditional expectation parameters. The counterfactual framework has four key conditional expectations (plus the treatment probability $\pi$):

1.  $E[Y(1) | D=1]$: Treated outcome for the treated.
2.  $E[Y(0) | D=1]$: Untreated outcome for the treated (**Counterfactual**).
3.  $E[Y(1) | D=0]$: Treated outcome for the control (**Counterfactual**).
4.  $E[Y(0) | D=0]$: Untreated outcome for the control.

The naive estimator consistently estimate 1 and 4. The treatment probability ($\hat{E}[D] \xrightarrow{p} \pi$) is also consistently estimated. So using a naive esitimator means using these three quantities.
ATE is expressed by these five parameters as follows:
$$\tau_{ATE} = \pi \underbrace{(E[Y(1)|D=1] - E[Y(0)|D=1])}_{\text{ATT}} + (1-\pi) \underbrace{(E[Y(1)|D=0] - E[Y(0)|D=0])}_{\text{ATU}}$$
If we attempt to equate the Naive Estimator to the true ATE, the terms do not cancel out gracefully without some assumption because there are many possible values or 2 and 3 that the equation do not hold.  However, we lack estimators for the two counterfactual terms (2 and 3).
 

### 2. The Identification Condition
For the Naive Estimator to yield a valid causal effect, the Selection Bias term must be eliminated. This requires the condition:
$$ E[Y(0) | D=1] = E[Y(0) | D=0] $$

This equality holds under **Random Assignment (Independence)**, where treatment assignment is independent of the potential outcomes:
$$ \{Y(1), Y(0)\} \perp D $$
