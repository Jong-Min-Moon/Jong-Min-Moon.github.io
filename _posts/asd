### I. The Core Distinction: Decoupling
The fundamental difference between Wavelet Convolution and the Filter-Hilbert method lies in how they handle the two primary tasks of time-frequency analysis: **Filtering** (isolating frequencies) and **Analytic Representation** (extracting power/phase).

* **Wavelet Convolution:** Performs both tasks simultaneously. A complex Morlet wavelet is, by definition, a bandpass filter *and* an analytic signal combined.
* **Filter-Hilbert Method:** Decouples these steps.
    1.  **Step 1 (Filtering):** Apply a bandpass filter to isolate the frequency of interest.
    2.  **Step 2 (Hilbert):** Apply the Hilbert transform to extract the analytic signal (complex power/phase information).

**The Main Advantage:** By decoupling these steps, you gain significantly more control over the **frequency characteristics** of the filter.

### II. The Hilbert Transform
The Hilbert transform is a mathematical operation used to extract complex information from a real-valued signal.

#### 1. Purpose
It converts a real-valued signal (which only has cosine components, $M\cos(2\pi ft)$) into an analytic (complex) signal by generating and adding the **imaginary part**.
* **Real Part:** Original signal ($M\cos(2\pi ft)$).
* **Imaginary Part:** Phase quadrature component ($iM\sin(2\pi ft)$).



#### 2. Implementation (The Frequency Domain Trick)
In practice (like in MATLAB's `hilbert` function), we do not compute this by integrating in the time domain. Instead, we manipulate the Fourier spectrum:
1.  **FFT:** Convert signal to the frequency domain.
2.  **Rotate:** Double the **positive-frequency** coefficients and set the **negative-frequency** coefficients to **zero**.
3.  **IFFT:** Convert back to the time domain.

### III. The Advantage: Filter Control (Gaussian vs. Plateau)
The primary limitation of Morlet wavelets is that their frequency shape is **always Gaussian**. You cannot change this shape; you can only change its width (via the number of cycles).



The Filter-Hilbert method allows you to design filters with custom shapes:
* **Plateau Shapes:** Unlike the Gaussian peak of a wavelet, a bandpass filter can have a flat top ("plateau").
* **Benefit:** This offers better **frequency specificity**. You can define a hard boundary for the frequencies you want to keep versus those you want to remove, resulting in time-frequency plots that are smoother along the frequency axis.

### IV. Filter Types
Using the Filter-Hilbert method, you can apply four standard types of frequency filters before extracting the analytic signal:
* **Bandpass:** Keep activity *between* two frequencies (most useful for time-frequency decomposition).
* **Band-stop:** Remove activity *between* two frequencies (notch filter).
* **High-pass:** Retain frequencies *above* a cutoff.
* **Low-pass:** Retain frequencies *below* a cutoff.

**Summary:** While wavelet convolution is mathematically elegant (one step), the Filter-Hilbert method is practically powerful because it allows you to shape your frequency isolation (e.g., using a plateau filter) before extracting the power and phase.
