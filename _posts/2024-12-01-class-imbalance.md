Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is diagnosed much more frequently in males than females (approx. 4:1 ratio). This imbalance poses severe challenges for statistical models, which often fail to capture female-specific patterns due to insufficient data. In this project, we introduce a **Cluster-Aware Generative Oversampling** technique to synthetically augment the female subgroup while preserving the underlying manifold structure of the data.
