### I. Motivation
For neural signals, the Fourier transform serves primarily as a computational backbone for convolution rather than a final analytical endpoint. Our goal is to uncover not just the frequency content, but the **time-frequency representation** of the signal. Simply put, for a specific frequency band, we want to extract the instantaneous power and phase at every time point, as well as the bandpass-filtered signal. This is achieved by convolving the signal with a **Morlet Wavelet** defined by a specific frequency. 


**The Goal:** We need a method for **Time-Frequency Representation (TFR)** that balances temporal and frequency precision.

### II. The Morlet Wavelet
To localize frequency information in time, we must restrict the sine wave so it does not extend infinitely.

#### 1. Definition
A Morlet wavelet is created by multiplying a **Sine Wave** by a **Gaussian Window** (taper).
* **Sine Wave:** Provides the frequency specificity.
* **Gaussian Window:** Localizes the wave in time and dampens the edges to zero to prevent artifacts.

#### 2. The Gaussian Formula
The shape of the taper is defined by:

$$
GaussWin(t) = a e^{-(t-m)^2 / (2s^2)}
$$

* \\( a \\): Amplitude.
* \\( t \\): Time.
* \\( m \\): Time offset (usually 0).
* \\( s \\): Standard deviation (width) of the Gaussian.

#### 3. The Standard Deviation (s)
The width of the wavelet \\( s \\) is determined by the frequency \\( f \\) and the number of cycles \\( n \\):

$$
s = \frac{n}{2\pi f}
$$

* \\( n \\): **Number of cycles**. This is the critical user-defined parameter that controls the trade-off between temporal and frequency precision.

### III. The Limitation of Real Wavelets
A standard "real-valued" Morlet wavelet has a major flaw: the result of convolution depends on the **phase alignment** between the wavelet and the signal.
* If the signal and wavelet are phase-aligned (peaks match peaks), the dot product is **positive**.
* If they are 90° out of phase (peaks match zero-crossings), the dot product is **zero**.
* If they are 180° out of phase (peaks match troughs), the dot product is **negative**.

**Consequence:** You cannot reliably estimate the "power" (energy) of the signal because the value fluctuates based on phase lag, not just signal strength.

---

### IV. Complex Wavelets & Euler's Formula
To extract stable estimates of Power and Phase independent of alignment, we use **Complex Morlet Wavelets**.

#### 1. Complex Sine Waves
Instead of a real sine wave, we use a complex sine wave defined by **Euler's Formula**:

$$
e^{i\theta} = \cos(\theta) + i\sin(\theta)
$$

This creates a "corkscrew" shape that spirals through time in 3 dimensions (Time, Real, Imaginary).

#### 2. The Complex Morlet Wavelet Formula
Combining the Gaussian taper with the complex sine wave:

$$
cmw(t) = A e^{-t^2 / (2s^2)} e^{i2\pi ft}
$$

* **Real Part:** \\( \cos(2\pi ft) \times \text{Gaussian} \\)
* **Imaginary Part:** \\( \sin(2\pi ft) \times \text{Gaussian} \\)

### V. Feature Extraction (Geometry of the Dot Product)
When you convolve a Complex Wavelet with neural data, the result at every time point is a **Complex Number**. This number describes a vector in the complex plane.

From this single vector, we extract three distinct features:

#### 1. Bandpass Filtered Signal (Real Axis)
The projection of the vector onto the **Real Axis**. This is equivalent to applying a standard bandpass filter with a Gaussian frequency response.

#### 2. Instantaneous Power (Vector Length)
The **Squared Magnitude** of the vector. This tells you "how much" of that frequency is present, regardless of phase alignment.
* **Formula:** \\( \text{Power} = \text{abs}(Z)^2 \\) or \\( Z \cdot \text{conj}(Z) \\)
* *Note:* The conjugate method is computationally faster for large matrices.

#### 3. Instantaneous Phase (Vector Angle)
The **Angle** of the vector relative to the positive real axis. This tells you the timing of the oscillation.
* **Formula:** \\( \theta = \text{angle}(Z) = \arctan(\text{imag} / \text{real}) \\)

### VI. The Uncertainty Principle (Parameter \( n \))
The number of cycles \\( n \\) defines the width of the Gaussian taper. This parameter is governed by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle for time-frequency analysis: **You cannot maximize both temporal and frequency precision simultaneously.**

| Cycles (\( n \))    | Gaussian Width | Temporal Precision      | Frequency Precision       | Best For...             |
| :------------------ | :------------- | :---------------------- | :------------------------ | :---------------------- |
| **Low (e.g., 3)**   | Narrow         | **High** (Sharp timing) | Low (Broad spectrum)      | Transient bursts / ERPs |
| **High (e.g., 10)** | Wide           | Low (Blurred timing)    | **High** (Sharp spectrum) | Sustained oscillations  |

#### Variable Cycles
It is common to use **variable cycles** (e.g., increasing from 3 to 10 as frequency increases). This adjusts the precision balance across the spectrum:
* Allows for better time precision at low frequencies.
* Allows for better frequency precision at high frequencies.
