# subsequent analysis

They’re studying **how sex (male/female)** and **disease state (e.g., ASD vs. control)** interact to affect brain function.  
They already have a *t-statistic map* — think of it as a brain-wide image showing where this interaction is statistically strong (similar to a regression coefficient map).

- Now, we want to **interpret** these interaction effects biologically.
    
- That is, *what brain functions and genes are associated with the regions showing strong interaction effects.*
    

1. **Cognitive decoding** → linking the statistical map to mental functions.
    
2. **Gene enrichment analysis** → linking it to patterns of gene expression in the brain.
    

## Step 1: Cognitive decoding

**Goal:** Identify what kinds of cognitive functions correspond to the pattern of sex-related differences in ASD.

- **Input:** their *t-statistic map* of sex×disease interaction.
    

1-1: correlation to first principal component

1-2: correlation to each cognitive terms

They use public databases that map **brain regions to mental functions** (from many fMRI studies).

- **Tools:**
    
    - **neuromaps toolbox** → compares their map to reference maps.
        
    - **NeuroSynth** → a large meta-analysis database linking words like “memory,” “attention,” “language” to brain activation maps.
        
- **Procedure:**  
    They calculate correlations between their map and “cognition maps” from NeuroSynth.  
    If their map correlates strongly with, say, the “social cognition” map, that suggests the sex×disease effect is most pronounced in brain areas involved in social cognition.
    

So, in statistical terms:

r=corr(t-stat map,cognitive function map)r = \text{corr}(\text{t-stat map}, \text{cognitive function map})r=corr(t-stat map,cognitive function map)

for many different cognitive terms.  
The terms with the highest |r| show which cognitive functions are most related to the observed interaction.

**What they did:**

- They used **NeuroSynth** and **neuromaps** — databases built from thousands of fMRI studies — which provide brain maps for different cognitive functions (like memory, moral reasoning, attention, etc.).
    
- They correlated their **interaction t-map** with the **cognition map** derived from NeuroSynth.
    
    - The correlation was high (*r = 0.771, p = 0.042*), meaning that regions showing sex differences in ASD follow a **sensory-to-association cortex gradient**, sometimes called the *cortical hierarchy*.
        
- Then, they further decoded the map by checking correlations with many **specific cognitive term maps** (e.g., “self-referential,” “theory of mind,” “moral reasoning”).
    
    - The highest correlations were with **higher-order cognitive control functions** — processes related to self-reflection, social understanding, and moral judgment.
        

**Interpretation:**  
The sex differences in ASD appear strongest in brain regions responsible for *internally oriented cognition* (default mode network), not in simple sensory regions.

### **Step 2: Gene enrichment (transcriptomic) analysis**

**Goal:** Identify whether particular **genes** show similar spatial patterns to the interaction map — i.e., whether brain regions with stronger sex-related differences also show higher expression of certain genes.

**What they did:**

- Used **abagen**, which processes microarray gene-expression data from the **Allen Human Brain Atlas** (a set of postmortem human brains).
    
- For each gene, they correlated its expression map (across cortical regions) with their **t-statistic interaction map**.
    
    - Genes whose expression strongly matched the t-map pattern were selected (|r| > threshold, FDR < 0.05).
        
- Then, they used a **developmental enrichment tool (CSEAtool)** to see *where and when* those genes are typically active — for example, which brain cell types or developmental stages show enrichment.
    

**What they found:**

- The correlated genes were most enriched in **cortical, striatal, and thalamic** cells — regions known to play roles in ASD.
    
- Prior studies have shown that ASD involves atypical growth and function in these regions (e.g., striatal overgrowth, reduced thalamic volume).
    
- This suggests that **sex-related differences in ASD connectivity** may arise partly from **sex-dependent genetic expression** in these brain systems.

## Equations

This theme supports rendering beautiful math in inline and display modes using [MathJax 3](https://www.mathjax.org/) engine.
You just need to surround your math expression with `$$`, like `$$ E = mc^2 $$`.
If you leave it inside a paragraph, it will produce an inline expression, just like $$ E = mc^2 $$.

In fact, you can also use a single dollar sign `$` to create inline formulas, such as `$ E = mc^2 $`, which will render as $ E = mc^2 $. This approach provides the same effect during TeX-based compilation, but visually it appears slightly less bold compared to double-dollar signs `$$`, making it blend more naturally with surrounding text.

To use display mode, again surround your expression with `$$` and place it as a separate paragraph.
Here is an example:

$$
\left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 \right) \left( \sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \right)
$$

Note that MathJax 3 is [a major re-write of MathJax](https://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/upgrading/whats-new-3.0.html) that brought a significant improvement to the loading and rendering speed, which is now [on par with KaTeX](https://www.intmath.com/cg5/katex-mathjax-comparison.php).

## Citations

Citations are then used in the article body with the `<d-cite>` tag.
The key attribute is a reference to the id provided in the bibliography.
The key attribute can take multiple ids, separated by commas.

The citation is presented inline like this:  (a number that displays more information on hover).
If you have an appendix, a bibliography is automatically created and populated in it.

Distill chose a numerical inline citation style to improve readability of citation dense articles and because many of the benefits of longer citations are obviated by displaying more information on hover.
However, we consider it good style to mention author last names if you discuss something at length and it fits into the flow well — the authors are human and it’s nice for them to have the community associate them with their work.
