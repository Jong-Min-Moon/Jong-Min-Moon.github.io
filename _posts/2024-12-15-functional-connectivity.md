We model the brain as a functional network where nodes represent regions of interest (ROIs) and edges represent the correlation of their time series (functional connectivity). To understand how ASD affects this connectivity differently in males and females, we estimate **Heterogeneous Treatment Effects (HTE)**. Our framework allows us to identify specific connections that are altered by the condition in a sex-specific manner.
