## Study Objective
We aim to demonstrate the recording efficacy of the neural interface system developed by Park et al. (2024) in detecting individual and population level neural activities in a freely behaving mouse model.

## Target Brain Regions
We implant neural brob in two distnct, functionally specialized brain regions to correlate neural activity with specific behavioral states.

| Target Region | Anatomical Location | Functional Association |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **CA1** | Hippocampus (Cornu Ammonis 1) | Navigation, spatial memory, and active locomotion. |
| **L6** | Primary Visual Cortex (Layer 6) | Visual processing and head-rotation motion. |

## Mouse task
Freely moving mice were placed at the start of the long arm of a T-shaped maze. As they traversed the track during the **active locomotion** phase, we monitored neural activity, specifically anticipating the activation of place units in the **hippocampus (CA1)**. When the mice reached the intersection, they transitioned to a **stopping and orienting** phase, rotating their heads to scan for visual patterns marking the exit path. This visual discrimination task was expected to drive neuronal activity in the **primary visual cortex (L6)**. Simultaneously, one neural probe recorded from CA1 and another from L6 to capture these region-specific dynamics.

| Task Phase | Behavior | Relevant Brain Region |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Task 1: Locomotion** | Running along the long arm | Hippocampus (CA1) |
| **Task 2: Orientation** | Stopping and head rotation at intersection | Visual Cortex (L6) |

### III. Task 1: Active Locomotion Analysis
We analyzed CA1 neural signals by comparing periods of active running versus stopping. Specifically, we examined the **Local Field Potential (LFP)** by filtering for the **Theta band** and analyzing both the amplitude and phase traces. Additionally, we monitored single-unit activity by calculating spike firing rates. If the neural probe is functioning correctly, we expect to observe significantly higher activity in CA1—manifested as increased LFP theta power and elevated spike rates—during running compared to stopping.

The experimental results showed that the neural probe properly works, as expected.

### IV. Validation Methodology: Phase-Locking Analysis
To verify that the recorded signals represented genuine neural physiology rather than artifacts or noise, the study performed a **Phase-Locking Analysis (PLA)**.

#### 1. The Rationale
The implanted probes capture a single raw voltage trace that is separated into two components via filtering:
* **LFP (1–300 Hz):** Reflects collective network activity.
* **Spikes (500–3000 Hz):** Reflects individual neuronal output.

Since both signals originate from the same biological source, they should be temporally correlated. If the signals were noise, the spikes would occur randomly relative to the background oscillation.



#### 2. The Mechanism in Context
* **Context:** During active running, the hippocampus generates robust **Theta oscillations (6–10 Hz)**.
* **Analysis:** The phase of the Theta oscillation is extracted (via Hilbert transform) at the exact moment each spike occurs.
* **Criterion:**
    * *Uniform Distribution (0°–360°):* Indicates random firing (No relationship / Potential noise).
    * *Clustered Distribution:* Indicates **Phase Locking**.

#### 3. Finding
The analysis revealed that spikes from CA1 neurons clustered around a **preferred phase** of the LFP theta rhythm. This confirms **significant phase locking**, demonstrating precise temporal coordination between individual neurons and the broader hippocampal network, thereby validating the signal quality of the interface
