        - Solved data science challenges for various departments within the Republic of Korea Army.
        - My primary project focused on developing a predictive model for forest fires triggered by artillery training sessions, leveraging meteorological data.
        -  A key challenge was addressing the severe class imbalance in the dataset. To overcome this, I integrated generative model-based oversampling with a weighted support vector machine (SVM).
        - This approach achieved a 99% improvement in prediction accuracy compared to previous models.
