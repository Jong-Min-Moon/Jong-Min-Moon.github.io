          - title: Built data integration and oversampling pipeline using R and SQL to augment Army training data, mitigate class
imbalance, and train SVM classifier enabling internal wildfire risk modeling in place of external indices
          contents:
            - Resolved meteorological data deficiencies by integrating Army training data with Korea Meteorological Administration
(KMA) databases via temporal and geospatial variables using SQL queries
            - Addressed severe class imbalance using generative model–based synthetic oversampling of wildfire cases
        - Pipeline development and data analysis results  <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s00357-024-09467-1">published in Journal of Classification</a> as co–first author, collaborating
with Army officers; contributed to pipeline implementation and real-data analysis
        - Enhanced pipeline with cost-sensitive training and derived theoretical guarantee, leading to <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.csda.2024.108078">first-author publication in Computational Statistics \& Data Analysis</a>
; contributed to theory development, experiments, and writing
