  Data augmentation and loss function adjustments are two common techniques for imbalanced classification.
  In cases of extreme class imbalance, it is often standard practice to combine these two approaches.
  However, determining the optimal oversampling ratio and the degree of asymmetry in the loss function typically relies on heuristics.
  We further consider the scenario where the minority class consists of subgroups and
  propose a straightforward method for combining data augmentation and loss function adjustments.
  This method serves as a sample-based approximation of the population-level asymptotically Bayes optimal oracle procedure.

	abstract = {
  Conventional neural probes are rigid, causing damages when implanted in freely moving animals.
  To address this issue,
  we present a soft, conformable neural interface system designed for
  long-term, stable monitoring of single-unit neural activity in freely moving subjects.
  This system integrates soft neural probes implanted in the brain with liquid metal-based electronics printed on the cranial surface.
  In-vivo mouse studies,
  employing dimensionality reduction,
  clustering analysis,
  and goodness-of-fit testing,
  provide statistical evidence of stable neural recordings over 33 weeks and behavior-induced activation across multiple brain regions during T-maze tests.
