	abstract = {
  Conventional neural probes are rigid, causing damages when implanted in freely moving animals.
  To address this issue,
  we present a soft, conformable neural interface system designed for
  long-term, stable monitoring of single-unit neural activity in freely moving subjects.
  This system integrates soft neural probes implanted in the brain with liquid metal-based electronics printed on the cranial surface.
  In-vivo mouse studies,
  employing dimensionality reduction,
  clustering analysis,
  and goodness-of-fit testing,
  provide statistical evidence of stable neural recordings over 33 weeks and behavior-induced activation across multiple brain regions during T-maze tests.
