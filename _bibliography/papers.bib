abstract=  {
Functional connectivity refers to the correlations between neural signal time series across different brain regions.
Its low-dimensional representation, known as functional gradients,
effectively captures differences between individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and typically developing controls.
Given that ASD is diagnosed more frequently in males than in females,
we investigate sex-related heterogeneity in the effects of ASD on functional gradients.
From a statistical perspective,
this corresponds to estimating heterogeneous treatment effects (HTEs),
where the treatment variable (ASD diagnosis) is imbalanced across a confounding covariate (sex).
Assuming that other known confounders have already been matched, we address this class imbalance by oversampling data from a cluster-aware generative model. Specifically, we fit a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to identify subgroups within the male functional gradients. Interpreting these subgroups as adequately capturing the structure of remaining confounding variables, we then generate synthetic male samples from the learned GMM to mitigate the sex imbalance. Our results reveal that several brain regions exhibit significant HTEs. Moreover, we quantitatively show that regions with significant HTEs tend to be those strongly associated with higher-order cognitive control functions, rather than lower-level sensory processing. Leveraging recent advances in high-resolution gene expression mapping across the human brain, we further find that the spatial pattern of HTEs is highly correlated with the expression profiles of a small subset of genes previously known to be associated with ASD.

	abstract=  {
  Artillery training inherently poses wildfire risks. Predictive modeling of these wildfires faces two key challenges: the scarcity of wildfire cases and the limited granularity of meteorological data during training. We address the first challenge by augmenting the data using a Gaussian mixture generative model and adjusting the loss function of a support vector machine. To tackle the second challenge, we integrate the Republic of Korea Army (ROKA) dataset with the Korea Meteorological Administration database. Our resulting model achieves a 99% improvement in balanced classification metrics compared to previous models.

	abstract=  {
  Data augmentation and loss function adjustments are two common techniques for imbalanced classification.
  In cases of extreme class imbalance, it is often standard practice to combine these two approaches.
  However, determining the optimal oversampling ratio and the degree of asymmetry in the loss function typically relies on heuristics.
  We further consider the scenario where the minority class consists of subgroups and
  propose a straightforward method for combining data augmentation and loss function adjustments.
  This method serves as a sample-based approximation of the population-level asymptotically Bayes optimal oracle procedure.

  Conventional neural probes are rigid, causing damages when implanted in freely moving animals.
  To address this issue,
  we present a soft, conformable neural interface system designed for
  long-term, stable monitoring of single-unit neural activity in freely moving subjects.
  This system integrates soft neural probes implanted in the brain with liquid metal-based electronics printed on the cranial surface.
  In-vivo mouse studies,
  employing dimensionality reduction,
  clustering analysis,
  and goodness-of-fit testing,
  provide statistical evidence of stable neural recordings over 33 weeks and behavior-induced activation across multiple brain regions during T-maze tests.

	abstract=  {We explore the trade-off between privacy and statistical utility in private two-sample testing under local differential privacy (LDP) for both multinomial and continuous data. We begin by addressing the multinomial case, where we introduce private permutation tests using practical privacy mechanisms such as Laplace, discrete Laplace, and Google's RAPPOR. We then extend our multinomial approach to continuous data via binning and study its uniform separation rates under LDP over H{\textbackslash}"older and Besov smoothness classes. The proposed tests for both discrete and continuous cases rigorously control the type I error for any finite sample size, strictly adhere to LDP constraints, and achieve minimax separation rates under LDP. The attained minimax rates reveal inherent privacy-utility trade-offs that are unavoidable in private testing. To address scenarios with unknown smoothness parameters in density testing, we propose an adaptive test based on a Bonferroni-type approach that ensures robust performance without prior knowledge of the smoothness parameters. We validate our theoretical findings with extensive numerical experiments and demonstrate the practical relevance and effectiveness of our proposed methods.},

	abstract=  {We propose an iterative algorithm for clustering high-dimensional data, where the true signal lies in a much lower-dimensional space. Our method alternates between feature selection and clustering, without requiring precise estimation of sparse model parameters. Feature selection is performed by thresholding a rough estimate of the discriminative direction, while clustering is carried out via a semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation of K-means. In the isotropic case, the algorithm is motivated by the minimax separation bound for exact recovery of cluster labels using varying sparse subsets of features. This bound highlights the critical role of variable selection in achieving exact recovery. We further extend the algorithm to settings with unknown sparse precision matrices, avoiding full model parameter estimation by computing only the minimally required quantities. Across a range of simulation settings, we find that the proposed iterative approach outperforms several state-of-the-art methods, especially in higher dimensions.},
