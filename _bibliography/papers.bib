	abstract = {Detecting sex differences in brain connectome organization in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) through statistical hypothesis testing is challenging. This challenge arises from the reliance of statistical power on the smaller group size, coupled with the significant imbalance in diagnostic ratios of ASD between males and females. While <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/01621459.2013.800763">Chen et al. (2013, Journal of the American Statistical Association)</a> addressed this issue using an ensemble of undersampling approaches, we take an alternative approach: oversampling. 
Our method combines dimension reduction via diffusion map embedding with Gaussian mixture model-based oversampling to balance the sex ratio in functional connectivity data. This approach reveals significant sex-related differences in the sensorimotor, attention, and default mode networks, with gradients linked to higher-order cognitive control. Transcriptomic analysis identifies gene enrichment in the cortex, thalamus, and striatum. Notably, gradient-symptom associations differ by sex, with stronger effects observed in females. These findings highlight the sex heterogeneity in ASD's large-scale brain networks.},

	abstract = {
  Artillery training inherently poses wildfire risks. Predictive modeling of these wildfires faces two key challenges: the scarcity of wildfire cases and the limited granularity of meteorological data during training. We address the first challenge by augmenting the data using a Gaussian mixture generative model and adjusting the loss function of a support vector machine. To tackle the second challenge, we integrate the Republic of Korea Army (ROKA) dataset with the Korea Meteorological Administration database. Our resulting model achieves a 99% improvement in balanced classification metrics compared to previous models.

	abstract = {
  Data augmentation and loss function adjustments are two common techniques for imbalanced classification.
  In cases of extreme class imbalance, it is often standard practice to combine these two approaches.
  However, determining the optimal oversampling ratio and the degree of asymmetry in the loss function typically relies on heuristics.
  We further consider the scenario where the minority class consists of subgroups and
  propose a straightforward method for combining data augmentation and loss function adjustments.
  This method serves as a sample-based approximation of the population-level asymptotically Bayes optimal oracle procedure.

  Conventional neural probes are rigid, causing damages when implanted in freely moving animals.
  To address this issue,
  we present a soft, conformable neural interface system designed for
  long-term, stable monitoring of single-unit neural activity in freely moving subjects.
  This system integrates soft neural probes implanted in the brain with liquid metal-based electronics printed on the cranial surface.
  In-vivo mouse studies,
  employing dimensionality reduction,
  clustering analysis,
  and goodness-of-fit testing,
  provide statistical evidence of stable neural recordings over 33 weeks and behavior-induced activation across multiple brain regions during T-maze tests.
